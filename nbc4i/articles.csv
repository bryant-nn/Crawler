COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — The Ohio Division of Cannabis Control shared an update Friday on how far along the state’s dispensaries are in getting approval to sell recreational marijuana.
As of Wednesday, DCC Public Information Officer Jamie Crawford told NBC4 that the agency had received a total of 244 applications to convert medical marijuana businesses to dual-use. From there, it reviewed the submitted paperwork and cleared 182 businesses for different types of dual-use licenses:
The final number in particular reflects the high interest among the state’s 126 total medical dispensaries to get an entirely new sect of customers. Some of them, alongside the lawmakers who approved the recreational sale rollout, also predicted when sales could begin. Rep. Jamie Callender (R-Concord), co-chair of the state’s Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review, shared an estimate of “mid-June” after approving the dual-use process. After applications opened, the CEO of Story Cannabis told NBC4 his dispensaries could start selling recreational cannabis as early as the week of June 23.
However, both of those predictions turned out incorrect. While several of the state’s dispensaries have secured provisional licenses, they’re missing the next piece of the puzzle. Crawford said on Friday that until they also get a certificate of operation, the businesses can’t sell recreational products.
“There have been no certificates of operation issued to dispensaries to begin selling non-medical cannabis at this point,” Crawford wrote. “A dual-use provisional license does not permit the holder to sell non-medical cannabis. It is issued as a placeholder while the provisional licensee works to meet the necessary requirements to obtain a certificate of operation and the division processes all required documents.”
The DCC publicly displays the applications for Ohio dispensaries to convert to dual-use on its website, as well as the status of its provisional license:
Cresco Labs, which operates both a growing facility and medical dispensaries in Ohio, has the lowest license number in the cultivator class. And Verdant Creations, with locations in Chillicothe and Newark, holds the lowest-numbered license in the dual-use dispensary category.
While Crawford noted that the DCC will “review and process applications roughly in the order in which completed applications have been received,” he clarified Friday that “the order of provisional licenses in e-license is not necessarily an indication of when a completed application was received by the division.” This means the lowest-numbered applicants in the database aren’t guaranteed to be the first to receive the needed certificate to start recreational sales.
“Think of the BMV model, where there is a single line but multiple windows open,” Crawford said. “A complicated application with multiple things that need to be resolved may get to a window first, but may not complete their certificate of operation first.”
Cresco’s chief communication officer, Jason Erkes, shared the dispensaries’ perspective on the wait for certificates of operation. In May at the company’s growing facility in Yellow Springs, his team planted the first crop of cannabis intended for recreational marijuana products. They’ll later go on sale at Cresco’s Sunnyside Dispensaries, with locations in Ohio towns like Chillicothe. Erkes believes his company’s hands in both supplies and sales may result in receiving a certificate faster.
“Being that all the products sold to adult-use consumers must come from both a dual-use cultivator and a dual-use approved lab, we think those will be the first operational licenses issued; otherwise the dispensaries will have no approved product to sell,” Erkes said.
Crawford supported Erkes’ theory in his metaphor for the approval process.
“Cultivators, processors and testing labs receive some priority because they are less complicated, and to ensure that products available for adult-use consumers can be traced back to a dual-use cultivator or processor,” Crawford said. “Dispensaries will be required to show they are able to properly process adult use and medical sales, as well as provide proof of training, which means they will take more time at the ‘window’ even if they are called up first.”
Erkes also shared the latest prediction on when sales could start: July.
“Since the passing of Issue 2 on the ballot, we have made significant increases in staffing in our cultivation and manufacturing facility to accommodate the increased demand,” Erkes said. “And likewise our five Sunnyside Dispensaries have beefed up to prepare for the influx of new consumers we expect to start shopping this month.”
People outside of Ohio’s formal marijuana industry are also trying to get in on the hype. In Ohio’s first full year with legalized cannabis, two festivals were planned in the summer months. The Stargazer Cannabis Festival is set for July 26-28 and endorses personal consumption of homegrown cannabis at the event. One of its sponsored activities includes a joint-rolling contest, which organizer Chad Thompson hired judges for at $100 an hour. But the Ohio Cannabis Festival, slated for Aug. 31 to Sept. 1, fizzled out in a dispute over its compliance with state law, with legal action pending from the organizers’ side.

https://www.nbc4i.com/weather/fourth-of-july-tornado-confirmed-in-logan-county/,Fourth of July tornado in Logan County adds to a record stormy year in Ohio,Mark Feuerborn,2024-07-05T12:59:37-04:00,"BELLEFONTAINE, Ohio (WCMH) — A tornado briefly formed in Logan County in a cluster of thunderstorms on the Fourth of July, adding another in a year that has already broken the all-time record in Ohio.
The National Weather Service in Wilmington confirmed that a “brief/weak” EF0 tornado touched down at 8:44 p.m. in Logan County. The storm touched down for less than 15 seconds and covered only .17 of a mile, with winds estimated at 65 mph.
The map below plots the latitude and longitude coordinates that the NWS provided for the tornado’s path.
The Weather Service noted some tree limb and patio furniture damage as a result of the tornado, but no one was injured.
Ohio came within record-breaking distance in June for its all-time count of tornadoes in a year. Four tornadoes from June 5-6 put the total number in 2024 at 62, tying the previous record for the entirety of 1992.
A minute-long tornado on July 2 in Huron County finally put 2024 over the edge, and the Fourth of July instance has taken Ohio to 64.
This year’s historically busy tornado season in Ohio and across the nation east of the Rocky Mountains is linked to a large-scale climate pattern, according to Storm Team 4 Meteorologist Ben Gelber.
He explained a fading El Niño (warmer-than-normal water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean) provided extra energy for Pacific storm systems that carved deep dips in the jet stream, pulling Gulf of Mexico moisture northward that clashed with cooler, drier air from Canada.
A secondary factor was the very mild winter with virtually no ice on the Great Lakes, which allowed warm air masses to push farther north in a southerly flow ahead of low-pressure areas moving northeast, creating created spin conducive to supercells, or rotating thunderstorms.
Three of the five most active tornado years in Ohio have occurred since 2019. In 2023, 60 tornadoes were tallied in the Buckeye State, and 49 were observed in 2019.
It’s important to point out that tornadoes are easier to count with the aid of Doppler detected rotation and corroborating videos, especially with the widespread availability of smartphone in the past 15 years. Some weaker rural tornadoes likely escaped detection decades ago.

NEW ALBANY, Ohio (WCMH) — A super load weighing nearly 1 million pounds is expected to delay traffic in several central Ohio communities over the next week as the 13th of nearly two dozen such shipments heads to Intel’s Ohio One plant.
The Ohio Department of Transportation began moving the super loads in March. Most, but not all, have been transported to the construction site of the Intel semiconductor plant, with the first few going to a recycling facility near Hebron.
On June 25, the first of four “extra large super loads,” the largest shipments in the project, arrived at Intel. Measuring in at around 23 feet tall, 20 feet wide, 280 feet long and weighing in at 916,000 pounds, three more shipments will travel across Ohio in the coming weeks.
Like the one before it, this extra large super load carries an air processor — or a cold box — used in Intel’s silicon chip manufacturing process.
On July 8, the second of these extra-large shipments will begin its journey, stopping in multiple central Ohio townships and cities along the way. It will continue along the following route, before its estimated arrival on July 16:
The load will then be delivered to its destination at the construction site of Intel’s Ohio One plant in New Albany, which was recently confirmed to be on a delayed timeline.

Mike DeWine has ordered flags at half-staff starting on the Fourth of July after a shooting in Cleveland left an officer dead.
The governor has requested flags to remain lowered from Thursday through sunset on the day of Cleveland Officer Jamieson Ritter’s funeral. The order applies to all state and U.S. flags on public buildings and grounds in Cuyahoga County and at the Ohio Statehouse, as well as Rhodes State Office Tower in Columbus.
“On this Independence Day, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the sacrifices our law enforcement and military members make in support of freedom and public safety,” DeWine said.
Ritter, 27, was shot just before 1 a.m. Thursday while looking near Wade Park for a man wanted on a felonious assault charge. The suspect, 24-year-old Delawnte Hardy, tried to escape on a bike before pulling out a gun and firing shots, FOX 8 reported.
The identity of the officer, who was a four-year veteran of the department, was revealed Thursday afternoon. Cleveland Police Chief Dorothy Todd said Ritter’s death is hitting everyone on the force hard. The city’s mayor, Justin Bibb, asked for the city to pray for the officer’s family and for all the officers, especially in light of the July 4 holiday.
After the shooting, Hardy was arrested and booked into the Cuyahoga County jail, FOX 8 reported.

https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/grandview-heights/after-nearly-60-years-pauls-on-fifth-restaurant-closing-permanently/,"After nearly 60 years, Paul’s on Fifth restaurant closing permanently",Mark Feuerborn,2024-07-02T06:30:00-04:00,"GRANDVIEW HEIGHTS, Ohio (WCMH) — The owner of a restaurant north of Grandview Heights that has weathered almost six decades in business has decided to close its doors.
Paul Panzera will be shutting down his diner, Paul’s on Fifth Avenue, on Sunday, his oldest son Anthony told NBC4. Anthony explained his father made the decision for a “collective of reasons,” including the changing restaurant industry after the pandemic as well as the demand of running one at 76 years old.
“It is impossible to put hard number on it, but when we estimate, we’ve served something like 7 million meals. As my father would’ve said: not too bad,” Paul said. “Now on to the next adventure — whatever that might be.”
Paul’s on Fifth grew through the 1980s with his recipes offering Italian wedding soup, lasagna, veal, chicken, and pasta dishes. Anthony noted that when his father launched Paul’s on Fifth, there were only six other restaurants nearby. As that number grew, Paul adapted the restaurant’s menu in more recent years to help ensure it still stood out.
Paul’s on Fifth later traded its dinner menu for breakfast and lunch diner-styled food, including omelets, home fries and other unique recipes. Anthony explained that certain customers and workers’ quirky creations became menu staples, like the “Dennis” sandwich. “Joe Fries” came to be after a cook consistently burned home fries, and “Callahans” were created by a woman who would order omelet fixings on fries.
The closure of Paul’s restaurant marks the latest in his history as a chef and first-generation American. He has a term as president of the Columbus chapter of the American Culinary Association and an accreditation as a certified executive chef under his belt. Anthony also said his father was a mentor to many apprentice chefs over the years.
All of that came from humble beginnings. Paul was born in Italy and immigrated to the U.S. at age 7. While his mother worked at an Italian restaurant and his father in the Marble Cliff Quarry, Paul started work at a local Italian bakery. While in high school, he later turned the bakery site into his first restaurant in 1966. He ran Paul’s Pantry restaurants in multiple parts of Columbus before being drafted into the Vietnam War.
Upon returning, he eventually launched Paul’s at Fifth Avenue in 1979 at its 1565 W. Fifth Ave. location. It grew in popularity through the 1980s and 1990s, and Anthony said that also gave rise to Paul’s Catering service, which lasted until 2005. In 2024, it was the last restaurant left under Paul’s management.
The Panzera family will still have a name in the restaurant industry, albeit under a different owner. Anthony confirmed that a sibling of Paul’s, whose last name changed with marriage, started Panzera’s Pizza close by. In fact, he noted the pizzeria predates Paul’s on Fifth by four years. Franklin County Auditor records showed Fred Lombardi owned the pizzeria property from 1992 to 2007 when Carlo Lombardi bought it for $300,000.
Auditor records also show the change of hands that Paul’s on Fifth went through in the last four decades. Charles Calvert owned the property until his son Charles Jr. acquired it in June 2004, but Paul bought the restaurant outright from him the next month for $475,000. In 2021, an LLC called 1565 West Fifth Ave. took ownership of the property at no cost, and still held it as of Tuesday.
Anthony grew up in Grandview Heights and worked in Paul’s for decades, but more recently moved into his own business format of real estate. But he always had one leg in Paul’s, in what he called his “volunteer shifts.”
The son said Paul’s has seen an influx of customers hoping to get one last bite in at the diner before it closes. While he said many of Paul’s regulars expressed sadness at the closing announcement, he viewed this positively, in a way.
“It’s only sad because it was great,” Anthony said. “When you’ve done something that right for so long, is it sad? People are really expressing their emotions this way.”

TALLMADGE, Ohio (WCMH) — One of two festivals planned on the eve of recreational marijuana sales in Ohio has been canceled, part of a dispute between organizers and local officials.
A Pennsylvania-based company, Zick Productions, said its team spent six months preparing to launch the Ohio Cannabis Festival at the Summit County Fairgrounds in Tallmadge. The event was set to run from Aug. 31 to Sept. 1, but by June 11 its website had been locked down to a solitary message.
“Summit County Agricultural Society has decided to cancel the upcoming Ohio Cannabis Festival contracted to be held Aug. 31 – Sept. 1 in a statement received by mail to organizers,” Zick Productions wrote. “This breach of contract was in accordance with city and county officials’ direction who cited ownership of the land, our commercial speech and state law.”
NBC4 reached out to SCAS, which maintains the fairgrounds, with questions about the cancellation on Thursday. An employee said over the phone that management was working on a response on Friday, but the group had not sent any statement as of Monday.
Tallmadge Mayor Carol Kilway said that while the city doesn’t serve as a legal adviser for the agricultural society or have authority over them, her team was in the loop on the decision SCAS made about the Ohio Cannabis Festival.
“Based on the event’s promotional materials, the city raised concerns regarding how the event would comply with state law,” Kilway said. “The event organizer was invited to address those concerns and did not respond.”
Jeff Zick, the owner of Zick Productions, gave his perspective to NBC4 on how this exchange played out. He called the city’s actions “governmental pressure” on SCAS and mentioned a “lease issue” with Summit County, the owner of the fairgrounds over the agricultural society.
“The City of Tallmadge invited Summit County and SCAS to a meeting about the scheduled event on June 3 at city hall,” Zick said. “The SCAS cancellation letter was dated June 4.”
An earlier copy of Ohio Cannabis Festival’s website preserved by the Wayback Machine shows promotional materials the city officials may have looked at. On the homepage, the festival showed the three sponsors it racked up were either cannabis dispensaries or marijuana product makers:
In a frequently asked questions section further down the page, however, the organizers addressed whether cannabis products would be sold at the event with the response: “Vendors will only be permitted to sell products in accordance with state laws.”
After getting no response from Zick, Kilway said the agricultural society made the call to cancel the Ohio Cannabis Festival. Zick Productions’ law firm, Thomas A. Will and Associates, told NBC4 that this was a breach of contract.
“Our client did their due diligence, contracted with the appropriate authorities, invested countless hours into securing vendors, and invested substantial time, effort and resources in the preparation of the festival pursuant to the contract our client had with SCAS,” the attorneys wrote. “Our client intends to pursue all possible claims against SCAS, and any and all appropriate parties, for this breach.”
Stargazer Cannabis Festival, organized separately by Chad Thompson, is going ahead as planned in July in Meigs County. He also had to clarify recreational marijuana’s role after the event website advertised a farmer’s market with video of adult cannabis plants. While the festival will allow attendees to bring recreational marijuana and even allow them to use it in a joint rolling contest, the vendors will only be allowed to sell cannabis seeds and hemp-derived products.
Ohio Cannabis Festival’s website said it would be issuing refunds and “offering remedies,” but did not specify if those would go to both ticket holders and vendors that signed on. It isn’t Zick’s only event, and two others remained greenlit as of Monday. His Pennsylvania Cannabis Fall Marketplace has been running annually since 2017 and will go for another round Oct. 5-6. The state neighboring Ohio only allows medical marijuana since legalizing it in a 2016 vote.
Zick’s Florida Cannabis Festival has run since 2020 in yet another medical-only state. But Florida voters will decide on a ballot initiative that would legalize recreational use, similar to Ohio’s Issue 2, in November.
In Ohio, the state’s Division of Cannabis Control plans to let medical dispensaries convert to “dual-use” to facilitate recreational sales. In June, the agency began letting the companies apply for provisional licenses to do so. While these don’t immediately let them begin sales, the dispensaries essentially reserved a spot in line for DCC to chronologically issue a license back. DCC Public Information Officer Jamie Crawford hinted “over the summer” for an estimate when they could start going out, with September being named as the absolute latest sales could begin.
Some of the businesses anticipate sales will start sooner rather than later. Cresco Labs, which owns dispensaries in Ohio as well as its own Yellow Springs cannabis growing greenhouse, planted its first crop of recreational marijuana in May.

The boy’s mother, Lashanda Wilder, 32, and her girlfriend Johnna Lowe, 33, are due in Franklin County Municipal Court on Monday morning; Wilder is facing murder and obstruction of justice charges while Lowe is facing an obstruction of justice charge.
Court records state the Franklin County Coroner’s office ruled on Saturday that the boy’s death was a homicide.
According to police, Wilder and two of her children were the subject of an Amber Alert issued Friday night. While investigating the case, Columbus police found the body of Wilder’s son, Martonio Wilder, in a trash bag hidden in the attic of the family’s house, according to police.
Wilder’s two other children were found safe with one of Lowe’s acquaintances later Friday night after the alert was issued. They were placed in the custody of Franklin County Children Services.
Columbus police were first called to the Wilder home at noon on Friday, where Wilder said she last saw Martonio on Thursday night, according to court records.
Police issued a missing person’s advisory for Martonio but did not elevate it to an Amber Alert. They began a K-9 search of the neighborhood, after which Wilder and Lowe left without telling police where they were going. With them were the other two children, ages 9 and 3.
When police couldn’t locate Wilder, officers got a search warrant for the home, which led to the discovery of the boy’s body.
Arrest warrants for both Wilder and Lowe were issued early Saturday; both were in police custody by 5 p.m.

The other two children were left with an acquaintance of Lowe’s, while Lowe and Wilder left separately. The brothers were found after the Amber Alert was issued, and arrest warrants were issued Saturday for both women. Police say they were taken into custody about 5 p.m.
Both women are scheduled to be arraigned in Franklin County Municipal Court on Monday morning.
Franklin County Children Services said it had been involved with Wilder and her family since May 2022 but did not specify how.
On Saturday night, a candlelight vigil was held in honor of Martonio. Dozens gathered to lean on one another and remember Martonio for who he was.

Mike DeWine signs bill for Ohio’s $4.2 billion capital budget,Natalie Fahmy,2024-06-28T09:30:00-04:00,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — A signature by Gov. Mike DeWine Friday morning is sending $4.2 billion across the state.
“Policy is made, and policy is carried out through our budgets,” DeWine said.
The governor signed the multi-billion dollar spending bill Friday morning. He was joined by several fellow Republicans including Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, House Speaker Jason Stephens and State Senator Stephanie Kunze. He announced his intention to sign House Bill 2 at 10:10 a.m.
The bill contains Ohio’s capital budget, as well as a $700 million one-time fund of excess tax dollars. That money go to things like the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, to the tune of $7 million, to a playground in Columbus worth $400,000 and a million-dollar investment for a park in Dayton.
The money goes towards everything from K-12 schools, jail projects and hundreds of millions of dollars to mental health facilities. The governor also touted renovations at state parks and their lodges as some of the items the funding will target.
“We’ll build more recovery homes so that people across Ohio can receive treatment in the comfort of a loving home,” DeWine said.
Additionally, Husted also spoke, mentioning funding for cybersecurity training at the state’s universities. There is also an investment in the Ohio State Highway Patrol Crime Lab to conduct toxicology testing, as DeWine said drugged driving was the result of 44% of fatal highway crashes.
“Currently this lab is in an aging warehouse with worn-out infrastructure and no room to expand to meet increasing caseload,” he said.
DeWine said there will be a “sustained demand” for a workforce in Ohio and that is why the state has been and will continue to also invest in pathways to fill these jobs.
“We need to make it easier for older workers to stay in the workforce; we want them to do that,” Husted said. “But we also need to create a faster pathway to get young people in.”
The bill passed the House and Senate on Wednesday during the final day of their session before their summer break. It contained a clause that allowed the money to go toward the projects as soon as it was signed.

Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted announced Vantage Data Centers this week as one of nine projects approved in the state. The computer data center business has committed to $110 million in building costs and $75 million in machinery costs for the project, which will be located on Horizon Court near the intersection of Beech Road and Jug Street.
Vantage was selected by the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for a 50% data center sales tax exemption lasting through the end of 2033. The exemption is for sales and use taxes associated with equipment purchases necessary to the data center’s construction, with the credit estimated to be worth nearly $7 million. New Albany’s city council still has to approve the project, with it expected to be considered in August.
With over 30 campuses across five continents, Vantage helps cool, protect and connect the technology of hyperscalers, cloud providers and large enterprises. The company’s New Albany data center is expected to create 12 full-time positions and more than $1.6 million in annual payroll.
The Ohio Department of Development did not specify when the company would begin work on the project.
Since Intel broke ground in 2022, the part of New Albany in Licking County has seen rapid development as other companies follow it to the Silicon Heartland.
Intel’s $20 billion Ohio One plant is scheduled to be finished in 2026 or 2027 before becoming operational by 2028. In early May, Intel put out the most recent renderings of its semiconductor fabrication plant.
Other projects in the area include Microsoft, which has now bought over 700 acres in Licking County; Google, which has announced two data centers in central Ohio; and Amazon, which has acquired over $100 million worth of land in Franklin County.
State officials have looked to continue to fuel the growth. In July 2023, DeWine and Husted announced a $90 million project to fund local and state transportation projects, in part to accommodate Licking County’s new tech residents.
“It proves to Intel and any business in the world that we are delivering on time. We’re delivering what we said we would deliver, which is the infrastructure around this,” Husted said.
The plant has caught more than just the attention of state officials. In May, President Joe Biden announced nearly $20 billion in direct funding and loans.

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated with statements from an STRS spokesperson.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — In a move unseen in years for the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, its board narrowly voted to block bonuses to the investment staff.
In a 5-4 vote Friday morning, reformers now making up a majority on the STRS board took their first decisive action since a legal battle where ousted member Wade Steen fought to get his chair back. The board voted not to approve a performance-based bonus program for the STRS investment staff for fiscal year 2025, according to Robin Rayfield, the executive director of the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association.
An STRS spokesperson noted the board would discuss the program, called PBI, again at a later meeting. They also clarified that the budget approved for fiscal year 2025 still includes $8.5 million earmarked for the 2024 PBI program.
Investors working for Ohio’s retired teachers’ pension fund have consistently received annual bonuses ranging from $50,000 to more than $300,000 in the past. The bonuses landed even in the fiscal year ending in June 2022, when the pension fund lost $5.3 billion. In 2023, the board deliberated raising the total bonus budget to $11.1 million.
Steen’s return, as well as Michelle Flanigan’s election to take Dale Price’s vacated seat in September, meant that what active and retired teachers in Ohio called a “mandate for reform” will hold long-term power to make changes at STRS. The group’s demands include transparency on investments, an end to exorbitant bonuses for the investment staff and a return of promised cost of living increases they were denied for years.
The changes aren’t coming without pushback, however. Board members in favor of the bonuses, including Alison Lanza Falls, expressed concerns before the vote that STRS’ investment staff could resign if they didn’t receive the bonuses.
“When people feel they are not being treated fairly, and we’re talking about the investment staff here and I understand the issue with teachers in here as well, but when people do not feel when they have performance and below 60 percentile, at some point they will vote with their feet,” Falls said.
Multiple retired teachers sitting in the audience of the board meeting yelled in reaction to this statement, including the phrase, “let them walk.”
Steen was previously kicked from the board by Gov. Mike DeWine, before appointing G. Brent Bishop to replace him. But at the beginning of 2024, an appeals court determined DeWine overstepped his authority in removing Steen from the position.
Still, the governor called for an investigation into the board, claiming there is a hostile takeover by private interests at STRS. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost obliged, and called for the removal of Steen and Rudy Fichtenbaum from the board in May. In disclosing findings from his investigation, he accused the pair of colluding to “peddle to STRS a secretive and untested investment scheme” that would “spell disaster for Ohio teachers” — accusations both members emphatically deny.
Rayfield noted that the board scheduled a meeting in July to discuss what to do about the investors’ bonuses, called PBI, going forward. However, a representative from STRS said there was no special meeting planned.

The coroner’s office confirmed that Reginald Purnell, a 48-year-old man, died Tuesday morning from gunshot wounds. It previously named Darrell Walker, 45, as the first victim killed.
Officers found Walker and Purnell around 10 a.m. inside a house in the 1200 block of Seymour Avenue, near Deshler Park. Within minutes, the coroner’s office said medics pronounced both of them dead.
Dispatchers first sent Columbus police to the scene after a woman went to the house to check on one of the two men. When she found one of them with gunshot wounds, she called police. Investigators later found the home had a broken back window.
Columbus police have not shared any details on a possibly suspect in the shooting as of Wednesday.

Dispatchers sent emergency crews to the 800 block of Pierce Avenue around 3 p.m. on reports of a house fire.
Lancaster Assistant Fire Chief Slade Schultz said firefighters found the girl inside the burning building. They brought her outside, and she was pronounced dead at the scene.
Emergency crews also took a 55-year-old man who was inside the home during the fire to an area hospital. They did not have information on his condition.
Two other children — a 3-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy — and a 54-year-old woman were able to get out of the home during the fire, the Lancaster police reported. The boy was taken to the hospital for treatment; the extent of his injuries is not known.
“It’s the type of call that we all know can happen, but we all, in the back of our minds, never want it to happen to us,” Schultz said.
He said he sent home the firefighters first on the scene after a long, emotional day.
“They know that they did everything they could to save that little girl,” Schultz said. “They’re going to take it pretty hard.”
Investigators had not shared a potential cause of the fire as of Wednesday evening. Schultz said the home had no working smoke alarms.
“Hopefully we can educate the community and educate those so we can hopefully prevent something like this from happening ever again,” Schultz said.
Two dogs also died in the fire.
As of 9 p.m. Wednesday, Lancaster police said the roads in the area of the 800 block of North Pierce Avenue will remain closed for an undetermined time.

Behavior Coordinator Brandy Trott said Arthur Morgan’s breed can sometimes be aloof, or take more time to warm up to new people. However, that’s not the case with this 2-year-old dog, who follows his friends “like a shadow.”
“He’s such a nice boy,” Trott said. “He is all about the cuddling and the pets. I’d say kind of medium energy but would probably still like his daily walks and stuff.”
Arthur Morgan is a bit of a rarity among German Shepherds in that he has a white fur. His coat is a sign of progress he has made since coming to the shelter, according to Trott.
“He actually came in to us with a pretty terrible skin infection, which is still healing,” Trott said. “But we’ve made a lot of good progress so he just needs some meds, and medicated baths and he should be good to go.”
He can get distracted easily but does love to play with certain toys. Arthur Morgan also knows the commands sit and down, and is very motivated by treats and food. He does get along with other dogs, but Trott recommended he meet them before adoption.
Arthur Morgan is available for meet-and-greets at the Franklin County Dog Shelter, located at 4340 Tamarack Blvd. in Columbus, and costs just $18 to adopt. Below are some additional dogs up for adoption as well:

https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/grandview-heights/why-a-construction-crane-briefly-loomed-over-grandview-heights/,Why a construction crane briefly loomed over Grandview Heights,Mark Feuerborn,2024-06-26T06:30:00-04:00,"GRANDVIEW HEIGHTS, Ohio (WCMH) — A construction crane rose near Grandview Heights as another step in two sizable residential projects being built on demolished properties.
More specifically, the crane was positioned near West Fifth and Grandview avenues in the Fifth by Northwest neighborhood of Columbus. As of Tuesday, however, workers had disassembled the crane and it disappeared from the work site. A separate construction crew doesn’t have cranes, but has deployed boom lifts as they work on a property next door to Meister’s Bar on Chambers Road.
Before the crews could begin on their respective projects, they had to bulldoze existing structures at both properties starting in August. The 1350 W. Fifth Ave. project has been called Fifth X Northwest Apartments, and the Chambers Road project has been dubbed the Langham Community.
Both of the projects — launched by separate owners — share a common goal of whittling away at a housing shortage in Columbus, thanks to its growing population. With analysts predicting another 700,000 people will move to the city in the next 25 years, the Fifth by Northwest apartments and affordable housing downtown are examples of attempts to address growing demand.
Photos tell the story of the 1350 W. Fifth Ave. property over the course of the year, demonstrating its quick conversion. An excavator sat outside the property, which had its windows removed, at the end of August. After flattening the property, a concrete and wooden framework slowly appeared through the beginning months of 2024. The crane was visible as recently as April as concrete stairwells rose from the retail floor of the property.
The local developer Effler Commercial set its sights on what it called a “functionally obsolete” 1950s office building in 2023. It traded hands for $0 in a pattern seen over two decades, with the last owner to take it being Fifth X NW Property, LLC. The last group to spend money to acquire it was Grandview CBS Limited, which paid $1.5 million in 2000, according to records from the Franklin County auditor.
Effler’s president, Erwin Effler III, told NBC4 that his company’s Fifth X Northwest project will come with 164 residential units, 194 parking stalls and 10,000 square feet of ground retail space facing the street. The building will also include attractions like a second-floor pool and rooftop lounge.
Effler III told NBC4 that crews should finish the new apartments in the summer or fall of 2025.
A series of property takeovers from 2021 to 2022 led to a wide patch on the north side of Chambers Road getting flattened. Chambers Road Holdings bought multiple spaces and cleared them out, including the former home of Westwood Cabinetry and Millwork and a bracelet shop called DLJQY, according to Franklin County auditor records.
Since then, a single property called the Langham Community has risen in their place. It will be next-door neighbors with Meisters Bar, which was left untouched.
Photos taken Monday showed concrete arches forming on the east side of the new building, with some windows also having glass installed. The southwest corner of the building is in a much earlier stage of development, as its wooden skeleton remains exposed.
A marketing director for the developer, Preferred Living, previously told NBC4 that the structure will contain 180 apartments spanning four levels. The building will also have two levels of parking.
The company predicts the apartments will be completed in early 2025.

https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/delaware-county/delaware-county-growth-spurs-infrastructure-investments/,Delaware County growth spurs infrastructure investments,Jerod Smalley,2024-06-24T19:00:00-04:00,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Delaware County’s population is growing rapidly, sparking massive investment plans.
According to the U.S. Census, more than 5,100 people moved into the county in 2023 alone. The county has gained more than 17,000 residents just in the past four years. The county’s population is now approaching 232,000 people, a stark increase from its 2010 population of 174,000 residents.
“We know Delaware County continues to grow fast, fast, fast … and I see no sign that that’s going to abate,” Gov. Mike DeWine said. 
Situated just north of Columbus, much of the recent sprawl into Delaware County can be attributed to its location and job opportunities. Chase, in the Polaris area, is Delaware County’s largest employer with more than 12,000 workers. Further employment hubs lie just across county lines. 
“We’re sitting in between probably the two biggest private sector employers in central Ohio, between Honda and Intel,” Delaware County Commissioner Jeff Benton said. “Before Intel was announced, the east side of the county, it was honestly pretty quiet. Our border is a mile from the Intel headquarters, so we’re going to see it.”
The rush of people has forced county leaders to create “Smart Growth” plans to supply basic infrastructure, like waste services, to new areas. The county’s master plan for sewer and water treatment services calls for $265 million in improvements over 15 years. 
“Trying to strategize how to bring sewer to different areas that don’t currently have it is, it’s very fulfilling,” Tiffany Maag, director of the Delaware County Regional Sewer District, said.
Earlier this month, DeWine and Ohio Department of Transportation leaders announced a major proposal to renovate U.S. 23 between I-270 and the city of Waldo. ODOT says that stretch of road is currently servicing 30% more traffic than the road was designed to handle.
ODOT is hoping to reduce the number of traffic stops along that stretch of road from 39 to seven or fewer. ODOT Director Jack Marchbanks said cost estimations for the proposal range between $1.4 and $1.9 billion.
“We’re all in a big hurry to do this, but this is not going to happen overnight. We’re talking about a number of years,” DeWine said. 
County engineers are also planning for $150 million in roadway improvements over the next five years, alongside pursuits to better the county’s quality of life.
“Things like parks and trails are very important to businesses to grow or expand. Schools are probably equally important,” Benton said. “And we think we provide all of those things so that we can attract and grow businesses.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — A chain of grilled cheese restaurants based entirely within Ohio has filed for bankruptcy, documents from federal court show.
The owners of Melt Bar and Grilled filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 14 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Ohio. Judge Alan M. Koschik granted an emergency order in the case on Friday, which will allow the chain to pay $100,000 in “wages, salaries and employee benefits” through a KeyBank payroll account, as well as reimburse employee business expenses from the pay period through June 14. However, the order also blocks Melt from paying “severance, vacation pay or bonuses” without additional action from the judge.
In the initial bankruptcy filing, Melt’s owner Matthew Fish shared a 2022 income tax return for the business. It reported income of nearly $9 million, but then claimed losses of almost $5 million after factoring in rent for its storefronts, taxes, salaries and wages, and compensation of officers.
Fish also disclosed Melt had standing estimated liabilities of between $1 million and $10 million, with at least 100 creditors it had debts to. He noted the company’s liquidated debts were less than $7.5 million.
The owner shared a statement with NBC4 regarding the bankruptcy filing, blaming a “rapidly changing” world and industry after the pandemic with “growing economic issues.”
“This gives us the best opportunity to reorganize and rebuild the company,” Fish said. “I refuse to let the company I have put my entire life into for the past nearly 2 decades end. I sincerely hope our staff, friends and loyal guests will continue to support us through this difficult decision and transition.”
Melt Bar and Grilled closed one of its Columbus shops off of High Street in July 2022, leaving a solitary location at Easton Town Center. Fish cited “very difficult staffing challenges” and “major cost increases” as two specific reasons why he decided to shut it down.
That leftover location at the Columbus shopping center also ran into trouble on May 16, as the Easton Gateway property company sued the restaurant. The plaintiff claimed in Franklin County Common Pleas Court documents that it sent a notice about unpaid rent to Melt on Nov. 9, then a second notice on April 10. The landlord said Melt owes them more than $200,000 in rent, interest and attorney’s fees.
A marketing manager for Melt declined to comment regarding the unpaid rent lawsuit. As of Friday, no attorney has filed to represent Melt Bar and Grilled in the case, but a trial is scheduled for March 16, 2025.
Koschik scheduled a status conference in the bankruptcy case for Aug. 6. He gave all of Melt’s creditors, excluding government agencies, a deadline of Aug. 27 to file claims on Melt’s assets.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Traffic is expected to be delayed in several central Ohio communities over the next week by the 12th of nearly two dozen super-load shipments going to Intel’s Ohio One plant under construction in New Albany. 
But this one is different than those that came before it. 
Measuring in at around 23 feet tall, 20 feet wide, 280 feet long and weighing in at 916,000 pounds, this is the first of four “extra large super loads,” the largest shipments in the project, the Ohio Department of Transportation said. With previous shipments taking just a few days, this load — which began its trip Sunday — is expected to take over a week, currently in the middle of an estimated 10-day route. 
Due to its size, local governments and other partners have helped to move obstructions like traffic signals and overhead signs. 
The shipment carries an air processor — or a cold box — used in Intel’s silicon chip manufacturing process and is part of Intel’s Ohio One plant, which was recently confirmed to be on a delayed timeline. 
Stopping in multiple central Ohio townships and cities along its way, the shipment is expected to continue along the following route, before its estimated arrival on Tuesday:

https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/ai-chatbot-taking-orders-at-columbus-wendys-as-part-of-test-run/,AI chatbot taking orders at Columbus Wendy’s with test results revealed,Mark Feuerborn,2024-06-21T05:30:00-04:00,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Wendy’s has deployed an artificial intelligence chatbot at drive-thrus for at least four Columbus area restaurants, including its shop in Clintonville.
The company headquartered in Dublin previously told NBC4 of plans to test what it called FreshAI at an undisclosed Columbus storefront in June 2023. By December, Wendy’s Chief Information Officer Matt Spessard said the number of locations testing the generative AI had quadrupled. On Friday, a company spokeswoman shared sites with FreshAI in Columbus had grown to eight as part of its pilot run.
The spokeswoman also revealed one of those FreshAI-enabled pilot shops was in Westerville, at 5771 Maxtown Rd. NBC4 went to the Wendy’s at 3592 N. High St. to test the chatbot deployed at that drive-thru as well.
FreshAI — made with Google Cloud and using a synthetic female voice — was able to identify itself when asked if the chatbot was taking an order. It also answered questions about the menu, such as the ingredients inside one of Wendy’s burgers, and named side options like fries available with a combo meal.
In an attempt to stress-test the AI, NBC4 asked to replace a previously ordered water with a lemonade, which the chatbot did without protest. It showed an itemized list before it finally revealed the FreshAI logo and the total cost at the end of the exchange. Text on-screen also suggested customers who “need to make a change or have questions” could talk to a real employee at the drive-thru window.
The rest of the drive-thru experience remained unchanged from what has become standard in American fast food. A cashier, who asked how the FreshAI experience went, took payment before handing over a burger, fries and drink.
In December, Spessard wrote that Wendy’s would deploy FreshAI at more of its chain locations across the U.S., citing test results of orders taken “22 seconds faster” with “averaged 86%” accuracy. While he stressed FreshAI was “an assistant — not a replacement” for the human workers in the company’s stores, he noted it may go beyond the drive-thru.
“We’re also offering opportunities for franchisees to pilot Wendy’s FreshAI in 2024, as we continue to receive interest from many who are eager to evolve their own restaurant experiences with this innovative technology,” Spessard wrote. “This could include integrating AI with the Wendy’s app, in-restaurant kiosks, mobile devices, smart home devices and more … however they choose to order.”
As of Friday, a Wendy’s spokeswoman confirmed that at least the drive-thru rollout had happened in at least Florida, but no franchisee-owned stores were testing the AI yet.
“Wendy’s FreshAI is now active across company-owned restaurants in multiple states, with more slated throughout 2024,” she wrote.
The FreshAI concept was first presented publicly by Wendy’s CEO Todd Penegor on his way out of the company. His replacement Kirk Tanner joined at the beginning of 2024, and was met with negative reception for another planned use of AI revealed in an investor conference call.
“Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling,” Tanner said.
After backlash on social media over that strategy, which was interpreted as “surge pricing,” Wendy’s clarified its new CEO was referencing a different model of “dynamic pricing.”
“Wendy’s will not implement surge pricing, which is the practice of raising prices when demand is highest. We didn’t use that phrase, nor do we plan to implement that practice,” the company said in a February email to NBC4.
Wendy’s Co. plans to invest about $20 million to launch digital menu boards –an apparent requirement for FreshAI and for its other artificial intelligence plans — at all of its U.S. company-run restaurants by the end of 2025. It also plans to invest approximately $10 million over the next two years to support digital menu enhancements globally.

CAMBRIDGE, Ohio (WCMH) — An Ohio attorney has reclaimed his license to practice law after admitting to throwing a can of his own feces into a victim advocacy center’s parking lot.
Jack Blakeslee, a Coal Ridge lawyer with over 40 years of experience, previously had his license suspended in November 2023 by the Ohio Supreme Court. The group of judges had charged him with professional misconduct after he threw a feces-filled Pringles can in 2021 at the property of Haven of Hope. The Cambridge victims advocacy center was scheduled to appear against him the same day in court for a capital murder trial.
The attorney was barred from practicing law as part of a one-year suspension over the case, but the court had held off on enforcing six months of that punishment as long as he did not engage in any further misconduct. After receiving an application from Blakeslee on Monday, the Ohio Supreme Court’s Disciplinary Counsel decided to reinstate his license on Tuesday.
When it first decided to suspend Blakeslee’s license, the court said a Haven of Hope surveillance camera, as well as one of its employees, witnessed the lawyer throw the Pringles can into the lot. Blakeslee had passed through an alleyway by the center twice in his car, and drove to the Guernsey County Courthouse for the 8:30 a.m. trial after throwing the feces.
The Board of Professional Conduct for the Ohio Supreme Court reported that there was clear evidence the attorney had committed the misconduct before suspending him. Blakeslee also explained in a deposition for the case that he threw the feces-filled can “to blow off steam.”
Calling his misconduct a “prank” that was “stupid,” Blakeslee admitted to throwing cans of his feces multiple times in the past. However, he said he wasn’t targeting anyone specific, and would throw them at random from his car.

POMEROY, Ohio (WCMH) — As an Ohio cannabis festival prepares for launch, it’s also looking to make multiple hires with a high pay grade.
Chad Thompson, the organizer behind the Stargazer Cannabis Festival, told NBC4 that he was planning to hire multiple judges for the event’s joint-rolling contest on July 27. The festival, weeks away from its inaugural three-day run at Wisteria Campground, is taking place in the first full year that Ohio has legalized recreational marijuana, and a little over a month after the state opened applications for sales at dual-use dispensaries. Thompson launched the job posting online late Monday.
“There’s two divisions, a classic division and artistic division,” Thompson said. “And in both of those divisions, one of the criteria is, ‘How does it smoke?’ The potential smokability.”
While the classic division will focus on traditional joints, Thompson said the artistic division could see intricately designed joints shaped like “tanks, cars and birds.” He also broke down several other factors the judges would be expected to review, as well as the eyebrow-raising dollar amount offered for their time.
“We’re going to be checking for the draw of the joint and the joint stability, like checking for runs and so forth and all that’s going to go into the judging process,” Thompson said. “And we’re hoping that the pay will be enough to get a large pool of potential candidates. … We are paying $100 an hour, you know, to just smoke joints.”
That hourly rate won’t be for a short span either, according to Thompson. He estimated the judging would take “a couple hours, if not more,” and for that reason the applicants need to be experienced beyond casual users.
“If they’re somebody who smokes maybe once a month, maybe they might not be the best person,” Thompson said. “But you know, if they’re a pretty regular smoker, I think they’ll be able to handle it.”
Thompson previously clarified that no vendors at the festival — spanning July 26 to 28 — would be selling recreational marijuana, and a farmer’s market at the event would mainly sell hemp-derived products. However, he did note recreational marijuana will still have a presence at Stargazer in other forms. Vendors will be allowed to sell cannabis seeds, legal even at the federal level, and with which Ohioans can grow up to six plants under the state’s current law.
Festival-goers will be allowed to use their homegrown marijuana at the campgrounds as well, including in the joint-rolling contest.
“It’d be completely legal to be homegrown cannabis, or they may roll it with hemp or they may not, I’m not gonna ask,” Thompson said. “I’m sure that there will be attendees that have legal cannabis with THC and will be consuming it, but there’s going to be no person-to-person sales.”
He also mentioned that while festival tickets are still available online, they have been selling quickly. Thompson told NBC4 that the Stargazer team would have to decide whether to sell door tickets on the weekend of the event “based on capacity,” but did say that they are no longer accepting new food vendor applications.
“If you definitely want to get into Stargazer, you definitely should buy your ticket as soon as possible,” Thompson said. “If you wait, there will be a likely chance you will not get in. I’m getting calls from all over the region.”
Thompson said applicants interested in applying to become joint-rolling judges, or just buying standard tickets, should visit the Stargazer festival website, and scroll all the way to the bottom for a link to the event’s job postings.

MARION, Ohio (WCMH) — A jury has convicted a Marion man who stabbed a woman to death in 2022 during Fourth of July celebrations at the River Bend Campground.
The jurors deliberated for less than two hours before unanimously finding Chadwick Allen Greenawalt Sr. guilty on all felony charges, Marion County Prosecutor Ray Grogan said Wednesday. They included two counts of murder, two counts of involuntary manslaughter, one count of voluntary manslaughter and two counts of felonious assault.
Testimony in the trial revealed that Greenawalt was a guest at the Natalie Rudd’s permanent family campsite on July 3. He popped a decorative balloon arch, making for a precursor to the deadly incident. After the Rudd family repeatedly asked him to leave, Greenawalt began physically fighting with Natalie Rudd, Grogan said. Her husband intervened before the other campers temporarily broke up the fight.
Greenawalt then started taunting Natalie before attacking her again with a knife. Her husband and a 14-year-old camper both witnessed him stab the woman multiple times, according to Grogan. The Marion County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded after the stabbing around 2:30 a.m. that day, but Natalie was pronounced dead shortly after emergency crews took her to an area hospital.
Greenawalt got on his motorcycle and drove away after the stabbing, but law enforcement found and arrested him on State Route 95. Multiple agencies provided evidence for the trial, including campground security footage that showed what appeared to be a knife clip on the outside of his pocket when he first arrived.
Grogan said Greenawalt will remain in custody while he awaits sentencing. Marion County Court records did not show a scheduled date for that as of Wednesday.

In a document dated for Tuesday, the Columbus police chief and director of public safety decided to terminate Officer Donovan Bever. They charged him with violating the division’s rule of conduct, noting abusive or violent behavior and violating its policy on use of force.
The document details multiple examples of Bever’s conduct during a Feb. 19 arrest of a 14-year-old boy as the reasoning behind his termination:
The officer was one of two to be fired within a week. In a separate case, Chief Elaine Bryant decided to terminate Officer Robert Spann after saying he engaged in “excessive” sex acts with a store employee while working special duty at an area Kroger.
Bryant sat down with NBC4 after the firings, describing her emotions after reviewing Bever’s bodycam video.
“It angers me. I’m disappointed. I’m angry. I’m frustrated because this is not what we stand for and there was absolutely no reason or justification for treating a 14-year-old or anyone like that,” Bryant said.
Director of Public Safety Kate Pishotti also released a statement Friday afternoon, saying the 14-year-old “deserved better.”
“Officer Bever’s actions were unacceptable, and as it pertains to his employment,
indefensible,” Pishotti wrote. “What I saw on that video and read in this investigation was wholly
incompatible with the values of the Columbus Division of Police.”
The video from the same Feb. 19 arrest showed Bever was conducting a traffic stop with another officer for a pedestrian in the roadway while patrolling in Linden. At about 4 p.m., they rolled up on two 14-year-old boys they had seen earlier. When the officers approached the pair of teens, they took off running.
“They were walking in the street, doing what kids do,” Bryant said.
The second officer got out of the police car within the apartment complex and ran toward the boys, while Bever drove the car around to a different area. When the second officer spotted the two teens across the lawn, he pulled out and aimed his firearm in the boys’ direction and shouted “Drop to the ground right now.”
Continuing to advance on the pair, the second officer yelled “Get on the f***ing ground or I’ll shoot you.” He then strained his voice to shout “On the ground” several times. The teens followed the officer’s instructions. He then approached and began to place one of the boys into handcuffs while he was face down on the ground.
While the second officer began to arrest the first teen, Bever caught up to the group. Bever’s bodycam recorded him running over to the other teen, grabbing the boy’s dreadlocks and shoving him face down into the sidewalk. Bever continued to pull on the teen’s dreadlocks to steer him, as Bever used his other hand to place the boy into handcuffs.
The footage showed Bever continuously pushing the boy’s face into the ground, while the teen is heard repeating “I’m sorry” several times. One of the teens can also be heard repeating “I’m complying, I’m complying.”
Bryant watched the bodycam video with NBC4 after deciding to fire Bever, describing these actions as the ones leading to Bever’s firing.
“At that point the excessive use of force, there was a head shove into the ground,” Bryant said. “There was some objects being thrown into the young man’s face and then you will see him stand up and escort him to the wagon by his hair.”
When Bever then rolled the teen onto his back, he could be heard saying, “You move, I will break your face.” While searching the teen’s pockets, he pulled out a phone charger and another unidentified object and threw them in the 14-year-old’s face. After forcefully rolling the teen around to his other side, the teen was visibly bleeding from his mouth.
Bever then took the teen to a police van for another search, holding him by his dreadlocks. Once there, Bever could be heard asking the teen “you got AIDS?”
Bever was relieved from duty three hours after the arrest but wasn’t fired until months later. Bryant said the division spoke with the 14-year-old’s grandmother, his legal guardian, after the incident.
“They were disappointed about the actions of the officers, but they were relieved and happy with the swift action that the department and the director of public safety took in addressing this issue,” Bryant said.
